# Short-Autohotkey-Scripts
To execute you need https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk.zip

This is mostly my backup but feel free to use it.

# List of Available scripts:

ImageSearchTest.ahk - This is to test if imagesearch is working properly and can find the image you are looking for.

Send on Click.ahk - This is the script that prints a chars from a string, whenever you press any key. You can use it for pranks on someone or to look cool while typing extra fast :)

Your Reality - Full Auto.ahk - This is full automated bot based on imagesearch to play "Your Reality" in Monika After Story. As long as you have mas folder and all pictures inside are correct resolution and size, it will go through all menus and play "Your Reality" on piano.

Your Reality - Only Piano.ahk - This is Send on Click.ahk but with the String being "Your Reality" default binding keys to play on a piano.

findmouse.ahk - It will print on the screen a mouse position one second after pressing Ctrl + Z.
